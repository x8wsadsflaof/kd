i will not say a lot of things since u judge me when i do talk about my feelings. but ill say enough where i can get enough off my chest to move on. but to be honest ur my favorite gf ive ever had, uve really made me fall in love with you and i dont know how since we were always hella different from eachother. ive always thought we were soulmates and we were put on this earth so we can meet in the middle of our differences and change the things we were always so insist on never changing. but obviously this is proven to be false. we probably wont ever date or even talk again, which hurts me, i really wanted it to be you krystal. i really dont know where we went wrong, i really treated you better than any guy can treat a girl, i changed, and was still working on changing, i realized the mistakes ive made, but every mistake ive made doesnt come close to all the shit u did, but i still stayed. and instead of trying to change u kept doing weird shit. but its fine i dont blame you, you want to live your life and i understand that. but id be lying if i said i wish the best for you, because i do hope your life falls down worse than my life shattered to pieces, but i wont get into my life. the best for you is probably dating someone else, which you probably have, and i think its best i say i do believe youve kissed and sucked kevins dick. and just incase u think im trying to guilt trap you i put that on my mom i believe that. obviously youre probably mad at this but its fine im used to that, i dont want you to respond to any of this or deny it. i think its best if we leave eachother alone. the most personal shit ill mention out of all of this is when u promised me ud be loyal and unfollow them. obviously you followed them again the next day thinking i wouldnt notice but i cried because of that, but ay enjoy your life i believe in that, ill be enjoying mine when im fully healed too and i can move on to another girl that i can love better than i loved you.
