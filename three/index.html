yes ive started arguments, it was for reassurance. obviously that doesnt make it better but when all you do is weird shit all i can do is seek reassurance. but instead of giving me it, you just get mad saying im mad for stupid shit, btw i think ive really only been mad at you like 3 times. and ive had asked nicely no arguing for shit, unfollow the norwalk skrap and break the streak with jeremiah, u dont listen when i ask nicely so i dont understand what u expect m to do. you probably wont understand this, and you are the type to not understand stuff until you learn it the hard way, and im the same way so i understand that feeling. ngl this is getting too long and i dont wanna seem desperate or like im still tryna chase you or vent so imma end it here. but just incase u think about dming me tryna talk. just to break your spirits i wouldnt date you unless you deleted all your socials and restarted them, yes that includes tiktok and instagram, and obviously we know u wouldnt so its best we forget eachother and never speak again. but i do love you krystal, and ill always have love for you. and i do hope you mature and realize what u have taken for granted. if one day we meet again, and not no impossible shit like meeting randomly irl, im talking about if one day, one of us builds the confidence to text eachother, then maybe we can talk things out, but it wont be anytime soon. goodbye krystal and make sure you enjoy your life!

theres still so much more to say, but maybe, maybe just one day we can have one more talk and i can say more!
