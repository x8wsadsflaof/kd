to be honest, i hate the current you, i miss the old you. i see you as a pick me now, you probably see different since u cant even see sav as a pick me. funny stray lol but i do hate that whore which i should point out. i really hope you mature and realize what youve taken for granted, but by then ill probably be long gone. you lie about the stupidest shit, youre too busy on not looking desperate to even worry about me and my feelings, but i dont blame you. i lowkey dont believe in love anymore. like u said ur not even emo and u just like their music and u wont look emo, but ur emo now, im not mad about it im just saying why would u even lie about that retard shit. but obviously ur immatureness u probably think im mad at u for being emo, but its whatever, u can have that negative energy towards me, itll just give me motivation, and to be honest i dont think i can get u jealous, even if i grow up rich, even if i get new girls, i never saw u as the type of girl who cared, ngl i think u dont even give a fuck about me. so if something happens dont think im tryna make u jealous, its just me focusing on myself. also i think its fucking stupid u think having sex with ur boyfriend is being a whore, but talking to 80 guys and complimenting every guy u see isnt? and idc about sex, i cared about you way more than words can express, just to let u know, i only asked about certain shit for consent to know what i can and cant do. ngl we never really understood eachother and i think its your fault, im not taking the blame for jack shit anymore, just letting yk, were too old for that, and youre old enough to take responsibility for ur dumbass actions.
